## Greetings ^^
### About myself
To briefly introduce myself: Hi there! I'm Chris, a German guy who started programming as a hobby years ago.   
Currently I'm still working mostly and preferably with JavaScript, the language I learned mostly by trial and error XD  
At school I learn Java as you can find it in the book - but I often deepen my knowledge in smaller experimental projects.

### About [JAND](https://github.com/JANDdevelopement)
Together with a good friend of mine I founded [JAND](https://github.com/JANDdevelopement) - a community and a project with many facets.  
[JAND](https://github.com/JANDdevelopement) is the community on which our Minecraft server runs, through which we publish joint projects like [GAL.002](https://github.com/JANDdevelopement#gal002) and under which name you can find our servers.  
Together we try to deepen our knowledge, present projects to others from time to time and enrich our community with our projects.  

### More projects
I am sure you will find many more repositories and pins on this profile in the future.  
Currently I have a few smaller projects on my personal account that are open source, as the bigger projects are still private ^^.  
Descriptions of these projects can be found in the respective repositories.  
If you have any questions about translation, please feel free to contact me :thumbsup:.
